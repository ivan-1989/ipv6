 IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4Ã—1038 addresses.

   Unicast:   An identifier for a single interface.  A packet sent to a
               unicast address is delivered to the interface identified
               by that address.
               
   Anycast:   An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
               belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to an
               anycast address is delivered to one of the interfaces
               identified by that address (the "nearest" one, according
               to the routing protocols' measure of distance).
               
   Multicast: An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically
               belonging to different nodes).  A packet sent to a
               multicast address is delivered to all interfaces
               identified by that address.
                          
There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6, their function being
superseded by multicast addresses.

To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.
